Final-year B.Tech CSE undergrad at the University of Kalyani. I enjoy designing and building practical, full-stack solutions to real-world problems, primarily using Python with Flask and SQLAlchemy. Lately I've been exploring FastAPI, MongoDB, and React.

🟢 I'm currently seeking a remote internship where I can contribute to challenging backend problems. Feel free to review my [Resume](https://farhanr22.is-a.dev/Farhan-Rahaman-Resume.pdf), connect on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/farhan-rahaman/), or reach out via [email](mailto:22farhanr@gmail.com).


## Featured Projects

### **JECAPrep.in** 
Co-founded a mock test platform for the WB JECA exam and led its complete technical development within a 4-person team. It provides JECA-format mock tests, topic-wise practice tests, and prep materials (PDFs), acquiring 13 paying users and generating ₹1,600+ in revenue over a 3-week launch. Built with Flask and PostgreSQL, the platform features auto-saving test sessions, secure paid content access (Caddy + X-Accel-Redirect), Google OAuth login, Razorpay payments, a comprehensive admin panel, and a CLI tool for structured test data ingestion.

### **Voyage'25 Fest Logistics** 

Built a logistics backend and automation suite for our departmental fest ***Voyage 2k25***, managing 120+ registrations, ₹1.2L+ in contributions, and 150+ item distributions. The system ingested payment and registration data from a couple of Google Sheets, provided an admin panel for payment verification, and a live booth page for on-site QR-based item distribution. Additionally, static profile pages were generated on GitHub Actions and deployed to Netlify, and a decoupled WhatsApp worker sent attendees their profile URLs.

### **SocketPoll (Real-time Poll App)**

Developed a full-stack, real-time polling application using FastAPI and React, backed by a MongoDB database. It features live result updates via WebSockets, configurable voting durations, multiple-choice question support and a clean UI with customizable poll colors. Implemented bot and abuse protection by integrating Cloudflare Turnstile for captcha-less verification and using browser fingerprinting to deter duplicate votes.

### **Official Departmental Website & CMS** 

Developing the official website & CMS for the Dept. of CSE, in coordination with the HoD and Faculty. Built using Flask/PostgreSQL, it features an admin panel with RBAC, is containerized with Docker and has automated deployments via GitHub Actions. A key focus was reliability, with database and content backups to Google Drive managed via `rclone`, and site health and backup status monitored through [healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io) and [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh) alerts.
